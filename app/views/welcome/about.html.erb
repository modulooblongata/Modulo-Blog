<h1 id="page_title">About Me</h1>
<div class="skinny_wrapper wrapper_padding">
  <p>I fondly remember my paperback copy of <i>HTML Goodies</i>. Under its guidance, I built an assortment of static websites to host whatever my teenage heart desired. This was the year 2001, when inline styling was a given. I discovered a love for sculpting a website from scraps of code, building it piece by piece.</p>
  <p>If I'd known then that I could make a career out of web development, I might have majored in Computer Science. Instead, my passion for human rights lead me to an undergrad degree in political science, followed by a master's in international studies. However, a federal hiring freeze prevented me from moving to Washington DC following graduation, and I found myself working a variety of office jobs while scrambling to "get my foot in the door." It was during this period that I co-founded a startup, Masspire LLC, with a friend and rediscovered my early enthusiasm for web development.</p>
  <p>Of course, the "World Wide Web" has changed a great deal since 2001, but I've always had a love for learning. I set to work brushing up on my HTML and CSS, then moved on to studying JavaScript and programming in Java. My journey here has been circuitous, but as they say: better late than never.</p><div class="about-container clearfix"><div class="col-about"><i class="fa fa-laptop fa4x"></i><h3>Responsive Design</h3><p class="text-muted">Building sites that gracefully degrade for the mobile web.</p></div><div class="col-about"><i class="fa fa-code fa4x"></i><h3>A RESTful Web</h3><p class="text-muted">Following the principles of REST in all applications.</p></div><div class="col-about"><i class="fa fa-html5 fa4x"></i><h3>Up-To-Date</h3><p class="text-muted">Staying current on the newest tech and minding the fads.</p></div><div class="col-about"><i class="fa fa-heart fa4x"></i><h3>Enthusiastic</h3><p class="text-muted">I'm passionate about web design and programming.</p></div></div><br><br><p class="clearfix">When I'm not coding, I can be found hiking any of Colorado's trails with my friends, or, in the winter, wading through banks of snowdrift.
