<h1 id="page_title">About Me</h1>
<div class="skinny_wrapper wrapper_padding">
  <p>I fondly remember my paperback copy of <i>HTML Goodies</i>. Under its guidance, I built an assortment of static websites to host whatever my teenage heart desired. This was the year 2001, when inline styling was a given. I discovered a love for sculpting a website from scraps of code, building it piece by piece.</p>
  <p>If I'd known then that I could make a career out of web development, I might have majored in Computer Science. Instead, I pursued another dream of becoming a foreign service officer. Unfortunately, that wasn't meant to be, and I found myself working a variety of office jobs following graduation. It was during this low point that I rediscovered my early enthusiasm for web development.</p>
  <p>Of course, the "World Wide Web" has changed a great deal since 2001, but I've always had a passion for learning. I set to work brushing up on my HTML and CSS, then moved on to studying JavaScript and Ruby for the first time. My journey here was circuitous, but as they say: better late than never.</p><div class="about-container clearfix"><div class="col-about"><i class="fa fa-laptop fa4x"></i><h3>Responsive Design</h3><p class="text-muted">Building sites that gracefully degrade for the mobile web.</p></div><div class="col-about"><i class="fa fa-code fa4x"></i><h3>A RESTful Web</h3><p class="text-muted">Following the principles of REST in all applications.</p></div><div class="col-about"><i class="fa fa-html5 fa4x"></i><h3>Up-To-Date</h3><p class="text-muted">Staying current on the newest tech and minding the fads.</p></div><div class="col-about"><i class="fa fa-heart fa4x"></i><h3>Enthusiastic</h3><p class="text-muted">I'm passionate about web design and programming.</p></div></div><br><br><p class="clearfix">When I'm not coding, I can be found hiking any of Colorado's trails, or, in the winter, wading through banks of snowdrift.
