		<h2>About</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>I'm a junior fullstack web developer based in Denver, Colorado. I've been building websites since AOL was a household name and dial-up modems were obligatory.</p>
		<p>Since then, web applications have evolved by leaps and bounds, and so have my skills in building them.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Responsive Design: Building sites that gracefully degrade for the mobile web.</li>
			<li>Object Oriented: I know object-oriented programming and how to work the MVC.</li>
			<li>Up to Date: Staying current on the newest tech and minding the fads.</li>
			<li>Enthusiastic: I'm passionate about programming.</li>
		</ul>
